# runway-priority
Our project for the Data Structure and Algorithms course at Habib University.
Efficiently managing the landing and takeoff sequences of aircraft at busy airports is 
critical for ensuring safety, minimizing fuel consumption, and maximizing runway 
utilization. The Air Traffic Control Simulation project addresses the challenge of 
dynamically prioritizing flight operations under varying conditions, including 
emergencies, VIP flights, and low-fuel scenarios. By simulating realistic traffic 
patterns and resource constraints, the system aids in testing scheduling algorithms 
and decision-making protocols that can be applied to real-world air traffic 
management.
